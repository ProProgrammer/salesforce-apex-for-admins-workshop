You should be familiar with the Declarative tools available on the salesforce platform that allow you to enforce business logic and workflow rules. 

These include:
* [Workflow Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=creating_workflow_rules.htm)
* [Validation Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=fields_about_field_validation.htm&language=en_US)
* [Formula Fields](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=customize_formulas.htm&language=th)
* [The Flow Designer](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=vpm_designer_overview.htm)
* [Approvals](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=what_are_approvals.htm&language=en_US)


Using these features you can accomplish a number of business critical processes in salesforce. Whenever possible, use the existing point-and-click tools, but there are some limitations to what you can do with clicks and we will be exploring those today.
