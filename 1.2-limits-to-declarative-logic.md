title: Module 1.1&#58; Declarative Logic

Once you have been building on the platform for a while, you have likely run into scenarios where you need code to accomplish your goals. Today we will cover TWO of those scenarios. 

1) **Modifying the visual representation of a page in salesforce.** 

Page layouts, mobile cards, home page components are all point-and-click ways to modify the way your data is presented in salesforce. When you have the need to change the organization and filtering of data shown in salesforce, Visualforce may be the best solution. 

2) **Cross-Object actions.** 

You can write business logic to update and create records of the same object type, or the same record by using the point-and-click functionality in salesforce. This is very useful to enforce business rules and automatically populate fields to ensure data quality and reporting. However, there are limitations to the automation and updates available with point-and-click. When you need to update or create records of a different object type, an Apex trigger is the best solution.
