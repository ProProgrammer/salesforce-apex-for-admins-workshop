Although you can view and edit Visualforce page definitions from Setup, in **Develop | Pages,** enabling Visualforce development mode is the best way to build Visualforce pages.

Development mode provides you with:
* A special development footer on every Visualforce page that includes the page’s view state, any associated controller, a link to the component reference documentation, and a page markup editor that offers highlighting, find-replace functionality, and auto-suggest for component tag and attribute names.
* The ability to define new Visualforce pages just by entering a unique URL.
* Error messages that include more detailed stack traces than what standard users receive.

To enable Visualforce development mode:
* At the top of any Salesforce page, click the down arrow next to your name. 
* From the menu under your name, select **Setup** or **My Settings**—whichever one appears.
* From the left pane, select one of the following:
* * If you clicked Setup, select **My Personal Information | Personal Information**.
* * If you clicked My Settings, select **Personal | Advanced User Details**.
* Click **Edit**.
* Select the **Development Mode** checkbox.

* Optionally, select the **Show View State** in Development Mode checkbox to enable the View State tab on the development footer. This tab is useful for monitoring the performance of your Visualforce pages.
Click **Save**.
