[Visualforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Visualforce:_An_Overview) is a key component of Force.com. With Visualforce, companies and their developers can create any kind of user experience and deliver it entirely on demand via the Web, without software.

By leveraging the database, integration, and logic capabilities at the core of Force.com, Visualforce provides complete control over the user interface of any application built on the platform so it can be tailored for any requirement, user, or device. With Visualforce, the power of the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model can extend to virtually any application and business requirement.

Visualforce lets developers use standard Web development technologies—including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery—to create user interfaces for their cloud-computing applications. Through a modern Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, these interfaces can be wired together with Apex Code—the Force.com platform’s on-demand programming language. As a result, Visualforce offers not only pixel-level control over the definition of an interface, but makes it possible to create new and sophisticated user interactions based on wizards, branching, and other UI logic.

With Visualforce, Force.com as a development environment is on a par with any of the application servers or database tools traditionally used for application development. Many salesforce. com customers are using Force.com to customize existing applications and create new on-demand applications, both for CRM and to support other business requirements. This Internet-based model of creating and running applications lets developers focus on productivity, not plumbing. For their companies, this approach means a better return on their IT investment.
