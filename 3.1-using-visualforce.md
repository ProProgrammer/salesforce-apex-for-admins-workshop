Visualforce pages can be incorporated into an application through multiple mechanisms. Here are a few ways to use Visualforce pages.

### **Display a Visualforce Page from a Tab**
Here, the tab called "My Visualforce Page" is generated by a Visualforce page.

### **Display a Visualforce Page within a Standard Page Layout**
In this scenario, Visualforce pages can be added to standard page layouts. To make Visualforce pages available in the page layout editor, set the standard controller of the Visualforce page you are trying to add inline to the page to that object. This standard controller can be both a standard or custom object; however, you can only have one object assigned to the standard controller at a time.

### **Display a Visualforce Page by Overriding Standard Buttons or Links**
Instead of having standard buttons access standard functionality and pages, you can override them to instead invoke your custom Visualforce pages. Simply go to the **Buttons and Links** page for the object you want to override, and click **Edit** next to the appropriate button or link. If your standard controller is set properly, you should see the Visualforce page in the override picklist.

### **Display a Visualforce Page Using Custom Buttons or Links**
Custom links and buttons can be added to standard page layouts, letting you call in to your Visualforce pages.

### **Display a Visualforce Page as the Target of a Link**
As each Visualforce is addressable by a URL, so you can simply link to the pages.

### **Visualforce Reports and Dashboards**
Visualforce can be used to create more flexible and dynamic reports and dashboards in salesforce.

Today we will be focusing on using Visualforce to modify the look and feel of the home page
