### Visualforce Home Page Area
With the [Summer '14 Release](https://help.salesforce.com/help/pdfs/en/salesforce_summer14_release_notes.pdf), you can now also use Visualforce to modify the look and feel of certain areas of your home page. Using the Visualforce home page component, you can customize the end user experience on the home page, without having to rebuild any of out of the box home page functionality like calendar, chatter, and approvals. 

Use Visualforce Area home page components to add dynamic content to your home page. For example, you can present content from partner apps, display charts in conjunction with the Analytics API, or add a canvas app to the home page.


We are going to add a Visualforce page to your developer edition environment, and then take a look at how to edit it and modify the information reflected. 


### Create a new Apex Class 
A custom controller is an Apex class that uses the default, no-argument constructor for the outer, top-level class. We are going to create a custom controller that will query the records we will want included in our visualforce page, and then later we will modify this controller to include additional criteria.  
A Custom Controller:
* Custom class written in Apex
* Doesn't work on a specific object
* Provides custom data
* Provides custom behaviors


**Create a New Apex Class**

1. From Setup, click **Develop | Apex Classes** and click **New**.
2. In the class editor, add this Apex class definition, and then click **Save**.

```
public class OpportunityPageController {
    
    public List<Opportunity> getOpportunities() {       
        return [SELECT Id, Name, Account.Name, ExpectedRevenue, CloseDate from Opportunity WHERE OwnerId = :UserInfo.getUserId()AND ExpectedRevenue > 20000 AND StageName != 'Closed'];
    }
 
}
```

This Apex class is querying all opportunities WHERE the owner is the running user. It is also querying the Id, Name, Account Name, Expected Revenue, and Close Date. We can see this in line __ where the controller is defining what data to "get". We will revisit this when we modify our Visualforce component. 



### Add A Visualforce Page
Now, since we have our Apex class added, we will add our Visualforce page. This page is what allows us to show this data we are querying in the class above. 

From Setup, click **Develop | Pages** and select **New** copy and past the code below into your new Visualforce Page 


```
<apex:page controller="OpportunityPageController" tabStyle="Opportunity">
    <apex:pageBlock title="Opportunities Overview">
        <apex:pageBlockSection title="My Opportunities">
            <!-- this grabs the opportunity list from the getter method in the OpportunityPageController -->
        	<apex:pageBlockTable value="{!opportunities}" var="opp">
                <apex:column >
                    <!-- add a facet to include a header, otherwise this column won't have a header -->
                    <apex:facet name="header">Name</apex:facet>
                    <!-- this cell in the table will have a hyperlink that opens in a new tab -->
                    <apex:outputLink value="/{!opp.Id}" target="_blank">
                    	<apex:outputField value="{!opp.Name}"/>
                    </apex:outputLink>
                </apex:column>
                <apex:column value="{!opp.Account.Name}" />
                <apex:column value="{!opp.ExpectedRevenue}" />
                <apex:column value="{!opp.CloseDate}" />
        	</apex:pageBlockTable>
        </apex:pageBlockSection>
    </apex:pageBlock>
</apex:page>
```

Name your page **HomePageOpps**

Click **Save**



Once you have saved your page, you can view its details, including when it was created, when it was last modified, and the Visualforce markup associated with the page.

From the detail page, you can do any of the following:
* Click **Edit** to edit existing page markup.
* Click **Delete** to delete the page.
* Click **Clone** to create a copy of the page. You must specify a new name for the new page.
* Click Where is this used? to view a list of all references to the page in your organization.
* Click **Show Dependencies** to display the items, such as fields, objects, or other classes, that must exist for this class to be valid.

* Click Preview to open the page in a new window.


### Create Visualforce Home Page component 
Since we have already created our visualforce page, we can now add it as a custom home page component. 

1. From Setup, click **Customize | Home | Home Page Components**.
2. Click **New**.
3. Enter a name for the component **HomePageOpps**
4. Choose the type of component **Visualforce Area**

5. Click **Next**
6. Select **Wide**, your new Visualforce page **HomePageOpps**, and Height of **200** 
7. Check **Show Scrollbars**

Click **Save** 


### Modify the Home Page Layout
Now that you have created a Custom Home Page Area using your Visualforce page, we need to add it to the Home Page layout so it is visible. 
1. From Setup, click **Customize | Home | Home Page Layouts**
2. Select **Edit** next to the DE Default Home page layout
3. Select the new Wide component **HomePageOpps**
![](http://i.imgur.com/OxkHB1f.jpg)
4. Click **Next** 
5. Click **Save** 


Now return to the Home Tab and scroll to the bottom. Your Visualforce page is there and showing your clickable opportunity records. Because you selected "Scrollable" all of the records can be viewed within the home page.
