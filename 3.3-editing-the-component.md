title: Module 3.3&#58; Editing the Visualforce component
---

You have successfully added a Visualforce page, created a custom component, and added it to the home page layout. Now your end users can view their opportunities right on their salesforce homepage. 

This page currently shows ALL opportunities owned by the running user. Remember the Apex Class we added earlier?

```
public class OpportunityPageController {
    
    public List<Opportunity> getOpportunities() {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, Account.Name, ExpectedRevenue, CloseDate 
                from Opportunity 
                WHERE OwnerId = :UserInfo.getUserId()];
    }    
}
```

The only WHERE we have defined here is the **OwnerId = :UserInfo.getUserId()];** 


### Update Apex Class 
In order to modify the SOQL query 

From Setup, click **Develop | Apex Classes** and click **Edit** next to the OpportunitiesController 

The 2 criteria we want to add are: 

1. Expected Revenue is over $2000
2. The Opportunity is NOT closed 

To do this, we will add 2 AND statements to our WHERE statement. Our original class includes this:

```
opportunities = [SELECT Id, Name, Account.Name, ExpectedRevenue, CloseDate 
                 from Opportunity 
                 WHERE OwnerId = :UserInfo.getUserId()];
```
So the 2 statements we want to add are 

    AND ExpectedRevenue > 20000 AND StageName != 'Closed' 

_more on comparison operators in SOQL_ [here](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/dbcom_soql_sosl/Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_comparisonoperators.htm)

Once we add our additional criteria, the class should look like this

```
public class OpportunityPageController {
    
    public List<Opportunity> getOpportunities() {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, Account.Name, ExpectedRevenue, CloseDate 
                from Opportunity 
                WHERE OwnerId = :UserInfo.getUserId() 
                AND ExpectedRevenue > 20000 
                AND StageName != 'Closed'];
    }
}
```

Now when we return to the Home tab to check our custom component, only the opportunities owned by the running user which are open and are over $20,000 are reflected. 


We successfully deployed a Visualforce page, created a custom home page component, and modified the SOQL query in order to reflect our open opportunities.
