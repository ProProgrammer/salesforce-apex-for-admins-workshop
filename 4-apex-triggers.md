title: Module 4&#58; Apex Triggers
---

Apex is used to add business logic to applications, to write database triggers, and to program controllers in the user interface layer. Today we will write an Apex trigger that will create a new project record when an opportunity record is closed. As discussed earlier, always evaluate if declarative functionality will be enough to accomplish your business goal. Since we want to create a record of a different object type, we will not be able to use Flow, which leads us to custom Apex in order to accomplish our business goal.
