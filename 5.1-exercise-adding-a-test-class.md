title: Module 5.1&#58; Adding a Test Class
---

Since we have written a trigger for to automatically create projects when an opportunity is updated, we now need to ensure this has proper test coverage. 


Lets take a look at what our test class should look like


A test class will cause the actions involved in our trigger. So our test class will need to create Opportunity records that match the criteria of our completed trigger.  This means the test class will call a list of test opportunities that are greater than 50,000, are New, and have a close date of today.

We also need to add our "boilerplate" code to the class to define what it is. We do this by naming it "OpportunityPageControllerTest" and also defining it as @isTest

Now let's add our entire test class to our developer org. 

Go to **Setup | Develop | Apex Classes | New**

```
@isTest
private class OpportunityPageControllerTest {
    static testMethod void OpportunityPageControllerTest(){
        Account testAcc = new Account(Name = 'testAcc');
        insert testAcc;
        
        List<Opportunity> testOpportunities = new List<Opportunity>();
        for(Integer i=0; i<10; i++){
            Opportunity o = new Opportunity();
            o.Name='Opportunity ' + i;
            o.AccountId = testAcc.Id;
            o.Amount = 50000;
            o.StageName = 'Negotiation/Review';
            o.Probability = 90;
            o.CloseDate = date.Today();
            testOpportunities.add(o);
        }
        
        insert testOpportunities;
        
        OpportunityPageController cntl = new OpportunityPageController();
        cntl.getOpportunities();
    }
}
```


The final test class should look like this
