title: Salesforce Apex for Admins workshop
---

This class is targeted at non-coders to be more comfortable when handed a Visualforce page or trigger. The main purpose of this class is to help admins/declarative developers how to be able to be able to analyze code to see what it does, give you the tools to be able to tinker on existing code to extend or modify functionality, and set a foundation for being able to build your own triggers and test classes. In addition, this class aims to point out not only what the programmatic features are and when you can use them, but also when to turn to code (after you have fully exhausted the declarative tools on the platform).

## Prerequisites
